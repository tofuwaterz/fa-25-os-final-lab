The code at the following link  Download code at the following linkis meant to do the following:

1. The parent thread creates a child thread that calls function sum, passing an integer as a parameter, and waits for the child thread to complete.
************************************************************************************************************

2. The child thread computes the sum of a sequence of 100 integers starting from the provided integer .  For example, if the argument is 20, then the program will compute 20 + 21 + 23....+120, print the result, and exit.

Unfortunately, the code provided contains multiple flaws. Please identify the flaws, describe them below, fix the code, and upload below the fixed version.

Suppose in a multithreaded process a thread makes a blocking system call. In which threading model(s) will this certainly result in a process blocking?

************************************************************************************************************
Consider a multi-threaded process with 10 threads. Thread 3 invokes an execlp() system call. Describe what will happen to each of the threads.

Explain the difference between internal and external fragmentation (in regards to the main memory).

Consider a fixed-partition memory allocation scheme consisting of 10 partitions with each partition being 400 KB in size.  The first partition is occupied by a 100 KB process. The third is occupied by a 50 KB process. The ninth partition is occupied by a 26 KB process.  The rest of the partitions are free. How many KBs are lost due to internal fragmentation?

What is a page fault?

************************************************************************************************************

Explain how the page table is used for translating a virtual address to physical.

Consider a process with a 16 byte virtual memory space.  The size of pages is 4 bytes.

How many pages does the process have? What is the offset size?

Suppose a process issues a virtual address of 12. What is the page number? What is the offset?

Suppose the process page table is as follows. In the above question, what is the physical frame number?

0	50
1	2
2	12
3	4

Consider the following segment table:

Segment	Base	Limit
0	100	40
1	200	50
2	300	60
3	400	80
4	500	210
5	600	500
Consider the following virtual addresses issues by the process.  What would be the corresponding physical addresses:

<2,10>

<5,40>

<0,54>
